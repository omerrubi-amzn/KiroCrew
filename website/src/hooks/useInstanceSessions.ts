/**
 * Live sessions from every CONNECTED remote instance, shaped as ordinary
 * Sessions-list rows so they can be MERGED into the local list rather than
 * grouped into a region of their own.
 *
 * WHY MERGED AND NOT SECTIONED: the sidebar already carries `instance_id` /
 * `instance_name` on a row (federated search populates them) and already renders
 * an instance badge and a remote activation path. Origin is therefore already a
 * PROPERTY OF A ROW in this component, not a bucket a row lives in — so the
 * honest shape for "see every session together" is one recency-ordered list with
 * the badge doing the distinguishing. A per-instance section would have added a
 * second grammar for something the row model already expresses.
 *
 * WHAT IS REACHABLE: the peer's `GET /api/chat/slots`, which the instance proxy's
 * allowlist already admits (`("api","chat")` covers the whole subtree). A remote
 * instance's OLDER sessions live under the peer's `/api/sessions`, which the proxy
 * refuses — and the one prefix row that would admit them would also admit
 * `DELETE /api/sessions`, session-restart, a memory read and a token-spending
 * summarize. So this hook returns LIVE sessions and the caller says so, rather
 * than rendering rows it cannot fill.
 *
 * SORT KEY: collapse the peer's `last_turn_ts` / `last_ts` / `created` ladder into
 * `modified` (epoch SECONDS) via `ladderEpoch`, and keep the raw ISO fields too.
 * `modified` is what this list ranks, segments and labels on, so deriving it once
 * is what stops those three from disagreeing — see `ladderEpoch` for why leaving
 * it absent produced duplicate date headers. `last_message` is NOT a timestamp: it
 * is an 80-char message PREVIEW string (`slot_projection.py`: `redacted[:80]`).
 * Assigning it to `modified` put a string where a number belongs, made `tb - ta`
 * NaN, and — because NaN makes every comparison false — left the WHOLE merged list
 * in arbitrary order rather than merely misplacing remote rows.
 *
 * BLAST RADIUS: one query per instance, keyed per instance, `retry: false`. An
 * unreachable instance yields its own error and contributes no rows; it can never
 * empty or stall the local list, which is the objection that sank an earlier
 * fully-merged design. Callers surface `failed` as one line rather than faking
 * rows for an instance that did not answer.

 * the list and emits a duplicate `YESTERDAY` / `LAST 7 DAYS` header at every flip.
 * Collapsing the ladder here once gives all three the same number.
